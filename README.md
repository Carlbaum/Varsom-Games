# Varsom-Games
Varsom Games is an entertainment system with the purpose of making players hook together and play video games on a tablet with their smartphones as controllers.
The project is developed in Java with the framework LibGDX, using KryoNet for the networking part. Varsom Games can be run on any iOS, Android or Desktop application. Varsom-Games comes with one pre-installed game Krazy-Razy, which is also developed by the same team.
For more details about this project, please see the [report](https://github.com/novalain/Varsom-Games/blob/Varsom-System/varsom-report.pdf?raw=true).

This repository consists of two separate parts; the main branch Varsom-Games is the entertainment system that runs on the host and the second branch ControllerApp is the app
that runs on each and every controller connected to the host. To run the projects, use the gradle file with the commands suitable for your device.
For detailed instructions on how to use the gradle file, see [this](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-on-the-Commandline) repository. With the apps installed, follow the steps:

1. Connect all apps to the same wi-fi hotspot
2. Start Varsom System and connect the devices to the server by following instructions on the Varsom Controller
3. Choose a game.
4. Have fun!
